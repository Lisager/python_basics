    "[Python](http://www.python.org/) is a very popular general-purpose programming language. Its popularity is mainly because Python is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clean and simple**: Easy to read the code, and simple to learn the basic syntax.\n",
    "* **Expressive**: Fewer lines of code often translate to fewer bugs and code easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is fun to work with Python because:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Interpreted**: No need to compile the code. The Python interpreter reads and executes the code directly.\n",
    "* **Dynamically typed**: No need to define the type of variables.\n",
    "* **Has automatic memory management**: No need to explicitly allocate and deallocate memory for variables. "

    "* Since interpreted and dynamically typed, Python code can be slow compared to compiled statically typed programming languages (e.g., C++ and Fortran).\n",
